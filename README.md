# ClinicOS Integration Guide

There are two main ClinicOS experiences that can be embedded into a clinic website:

1. **Onboarding Form**: A standalone form that collects patient information, captures patient photos, and uploads images. 

2. **Photo Capture Embed**: A photo capture module that captures images of the patient and returns them to a pre-existing form.

The **Onboarding Form** is the full form expereince that collects patient information and captures images. This is the full ClinicOS product expereince and is a standalone form that can be embedded into a clinic website.

The **Photo Capture Embed** experience is a standalone photo capture experience that captures images of the patient. This is intended to be used in scenarios where the clinic already has a form and only needs the photo capture experience.
