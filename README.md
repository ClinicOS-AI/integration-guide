# ClinicOS Integration Guide
This guide walks through the integration steps for the embedding the ClinicOS experience into a clinic website.

There are two main ClinicOS experiences that can be embedded into a clinic website:
1. **Onboarding Form**: A form that collects patient information, captures patient photos, and uploads images. 
2. **Photo Capture Only**: A photo capture experience that captures images of the patient.

The Onboarding form is the full form expereince that collects patient information and captures images. This is the full ClinicOS product expereince and is a standalone form that can be embedded into a clinic website.

The Photo Capture Only experience is a standalone photo capture experience that captures images of the patient. This is intended to be used in scenarios where the clinic already has a form and only needs the photo capture experience.
