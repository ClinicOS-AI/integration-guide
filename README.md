# ClinicOS Integration Guide

There are two main ClinicOS experiences that can be embedded into a clinic website:

1. **Onboarding Form**: 

A standalone form that collects patient information, captures patient photos, and uploads images. 

This form can be embedded into a clinic website and will appear as a floating widget on the website.
* Collects patient information such as name, email, phone number, and address.
* Captures images of the patient using the device camera.
* Uploads the captured images to the ClinicOS platform.
* Displays AI powered post-op visualizations to the patient.


2. **Photo Capture Embed**: A photo capture module that captures images of the patient and returns them to a pre-existing form.

This module can be embedded into an existing form on the clinic website and will appear as a modal window.
* Captures images of the patient using the device camera.
* Returns the captured images to the pre-existing form.
